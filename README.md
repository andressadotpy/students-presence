# Managing student's presence

This Python script was made to help me manage the presence of my students of 3 different classes.

## How the script works:
- The options keep showing at the screen until 3 is pressed:
 1. Add new student
 2. Organize students csv files
 3. To end the program
- If 1 is pressed a new student is added in one of the 3 csv files (depending on the student's class)
- If 2 is pressed all csv files are sorted, to easily be visualized.
- If 3 is pressed, the program ends.
