# Students presence

This Python program was created to help me manage the presence of my students of 3 different classes.

### Tests

The tests were made using ``` unittest ```.  
To run the tests, type on your command line:  

```
$ python3 -m unittest test_students
```

### Running the program  

```
$ python3
>>> import principal
```   
After running it, the user chooses if she/he wants to add new data to a file or just want to organize each file in alphabetical order.
